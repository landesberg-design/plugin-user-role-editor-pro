* Update: Posts/pages, custom post types edit restrictions add-on: child posts auto access takes into account all existing hierarchical post types, not only pages as earlier.
  Use 'ure_auto_access_children_for_hierarchical_post_types' filter in order to change this. It takes the single input parameter $hierarchical_post_types - the list of existing public hierarchical post types.
* Core version was updated to version 4.59.1
* New: Multisite: When update role at the main site with "Apply to all sites" option and PHP constant URE_MULTISITE_DIRECT_UPDATE === 1 (update roles directly in database, not via WordPress API), 
  URE overwrites all subsite roles with roles from the main site. It's possible now to leave selected role(s) for selected subsite(s) unchanged: add filter 'ure_network_update_leave_roles' and  
  return from it the array like this one - array( (int) blog_id => array('role_id1', 'role_id2', ... );
* Update: "Other roles" section is available now only for users with 'promote_users' capability.
* Update: Notice at the top of URE page about action result is not removed automatically after 7 seconds as earlier.
* Update: 'ure_sort_wp_roles_list' filter accepts these values for the single input parameter: false - leave roles list as it is; true or 'id' - sort roles list by role ID; 'name' - sort roles by role name in the alphabetical order.

= [4.59.3] 07.04.2021 =
* Core version: 4.59
* New: custom filter 'ure_set_cpt_own_caps' was added. It takes 2 input parameters: $do_it (bool, TRUE by default) and $post_type (string). Return FALSE for this filter in order to leave the default capability type for selected custom post type when option "Force custom post types to use their own capabilities" is turned ON at URE's options. If custom post type capabilities are not changed, related taxonomy capabilities are not changed too.
* New: custom filter 'ure_set_cpt_taxonomy_own_caps' was added. It takes 3 input parameters: $do_it (bool, TRUE by default), $taxonomy (string, like 'product_cat') and $post_type (string, like 'product'). Return FALSE for this filter in order to leave the default capabilities for selected taxonomy even if related custom post type will get own capabilities when option "Force custom post types to use their own capabilities" is turned ON at URE's options.
* Update: PHP constant URE_WP_ADMIN_URL was replaced with direct 'admin_url()' call to respect the 'admin_url' filter applied at get_admin_url() function.
* Fix: Navigation menus access add-on: action result message on success was not shown.
* Core version was updated to version 4.59
* Update: Editing roles and capabilities granted to selected user ("Capabilities" link under user row at the "Users" list) executes 'add_user_role' or 'remove_user_role' actions only in case it really grants or revokes roles and/or capabilities.
  Previous versions fully revoked and granted again all roles during user permissions update even in case roles list was not changed. It was leaded to the false execution of the mentioned add/remove role actions.

= [4.59.2] 02.03.2021 =
* Core version: 4.58.3
* Fix: "Multisite -> Update Network" did not work due to bug in version 4.59.
* Fix: Posts/pages, custom post types edit restrictions add-on: 
*    - Restricted user can some times see a full list of posts or pages due to internal caching issue.
*    - Media Library restricted items list did not take into account authors ID list restriction criteria for images loaded directly to the Media Library, which does not have parent posts.
*    - When products editing is restricted by product category/tag, product variations shown by "Admin Columns Pro - WooCommerce" plugin were not available. Now, if product is allowed, then related variations are allowed automatically too.
* Update: Option "Force custom post types to use their own capabilities" replaces default capabilities for the custom taxonomies also. 
It takes the slug of the 1st post type associated with such taxonomy (e.g. 'video') and builds own capabilities this way: manage_terms->manage_video_terms, edit_terms->edit_video_terms, delete_terms->delete_video_terms, assign_terms->assign_video_terms.
URE automatically adds such capabilities to the 'administrator' role. You have to grant these new capabilities to other roles manually.
* Update: 'edit_css' capability is mapped to 'unfiltered_html' for WordPress multisite, in case 'Enable "unfiltered_html" capability' option is turned ON at the URE's settings 'Multisite' tab. This automatically enables for a single site (blog/subsite) admin the 'Additional CSS' tab at the 'Appearance->Customize' page.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: New custom filter 'ure_admin_menu_access_not_block_url' is available. It allows to whitelist not selected URL (without path, like admin.php?page=mlw_quiz_options), which is not presented at the admin menu and it's not possible to select them with the "Block not Selected" model.

* Fix: Other roles access add-on: PHP fatal error was fixed: Uncaught Error: Call to undefined method URE_Lib_Pro::set_notification() in /wp-content/plugins/user-role-editor-pro/pro/includes/classes/other-roles-access.php:109

* Core version: 4.46
* Update: Edit posts/pages restrictions add-on: non-public taxonomies are not included into restricted database queries. URE will build now much shorter database queries for the sites which have a lot of such taxonomies at the database.

  It is critical for sites with large quant of users.New query does not take into account though some cases with incorrect users data (usually imported from the external sources).

et_pb_layout CPT is not available by default at User Role Editor pages (users.php), and we have to tell Divi to load et_pb_layout for URE pages via Divi's custom filter 'et_builder_should_load_framework'.

* Core version: 4.41
* New: WordPress Multisite: it's possbile to automatically copy selected add-ons data from the main site to the new created subsite. 
Use custom filter [ure_addons_to_copy_for_new_blog](https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/hooks/ure_addons_to_copy_for_new_blog/) to build list of add-on, which data URE should copy. 
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: 
*   - menu item title was shown empty at "Admin menu" window, if it began from '<span' HTML tag.

* Core version was updated to 4.41:
* New: URE changes currently selected role via AJAX request, without full "Users->User Role Editor" page refresh.
* Update: All [WPBakery Visual Composer](http://vc.wpbakery.com) plugin custom user capabilities (started from 'vc_access_rules_') were excluded from processing by User Role Editor. Visual Composer loses settings made via its own "Role Manager" after the role update by User Role Editor in other case. The reason - Visual Composer stores not boolean values with user capabilities granted to the roles via own "Role Manager". User Role Editor converted them to related boolean values during role(s) update.

= [4.44] 06.04.2018 =
* Core version: 4.40.3
* Update: Integration with bbPress was enhanced.
* Core version was updated to 4.40.3:
* Update: bbPress detection and code for integration with it was updated to support multisite installations when URE is network activated but bbPress is activated on some sites of the network only.

* Update: Admin menu access add-on: full admin menu copy creation code priority at 'admin_menu' hook was increased from 1000 to 9999. It should be executed after other plugins. MetaSlider plugin adds its admin menu with 9553 priority.
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: 
  - "Redirect to URL" option did not work for pages.
  - pages linked to BuddyPress components activity, groups, members ignored restrictions set by URE.

*
* Core version was updated to 4.40.2:
* Update: Load required .php files from the active bbPress plugin directly, as in some cases URE code may be executed earlier than they are loaded by bbPress.

= [4.41] 06.02.2018 =

* Update: Page permissions viewer add-on: source code tracing was returned back (if available).
* Update: Other roles access add-on: changes were applied for compatibility with PHP versions prior 5.5
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: 
* - HTML layout issue was fixed at the "Action" section of post editor meta box.
* - Restrictions were not applied properly for WooCommerce products list via [products] shortcode as WooCommerce may cache query result of unrestricted user for 30 days and show that cached data to users with restricted view access.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on (URE_Admin_Menu_Access::update_menu()): bug in menu update may lead to the indefinite redirection loop as a blocked URL was selected as the 1st available menu item link.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.40.1:
* Update: use wp_roles() function from WordPress API instead of initializing $wp_roles global directly. wp_roles() function (introduced with WP 4.3) was included conditionally to URE code for backward compatibility with WordPress 4.0+
* Fix: Bug was introduced by version 4.37 with users recalculation for "All" tab after excluding users with "administrator" role. Code worked incorrectly for Japanese locale.
* Fix: WordPress multisite: bbPress plugin detection code was changed from checking bbPress API function existence to checking WordPress active plugins list. bbPress plugin activated for the site was not available yet for the network activated User Role Editor at the point of URE instance creation. URE did not work with bbPress roles as it should by design.

* Core version: 4.36.1
* New: Required WordPress version was raised up to 4.4. Front-end menu access add-on does not support earlier WordPress versions.
* New: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: User with restrictions by categories can use 'Clone' link from 'Duplicate Post' plugin. The 1st category available to a current user will be assigned automatically to a new created post copy in order to make this post editable to this user.
* Fix: Posts/pages edit restrictions add-on: URE will extend automatically the list of allowed/restricted attachments for media library items, attached to allowed/restricted posts/pages/CPT.
* Update: Content View Restrictions shortcode add-on: Shortcode [user_role_editor] was not processed/rendered by default for a user with 'administrator' role, 
  following a logic "there are not restrictions for administrators". It's changed according to multiple user requests. Users with 'administrator' role will not see not rendered [user_role_editor]...[/user_role_editor] shortcode text at front-end starting with this update. It does not depend from a 'ure_render_content_view_shortcode_for_admin' filter value. All [user_role_editor] shortcodes are rendered for all users, including superadmin. 
  It's possible to change this default behavior via custom filter 'ure_render_content_view_shortcode_for_admin'. It takes a single boolean parameter. Change it to FALSE in order a user with 'administrator' role can see a raw content instead of a rendered/restricted one.  
* Fix:Front end menu access add-on: 
*   - Access filter is applied for front-end only to get rid off accidental deletion of restricted menu items.
*   - 'wp_get_nav_menu_items' filter is used now instead of 'wp_nav_menu_objects' one, which fires too late for case when some plugin uses own code to show WordPress navigation menu and do not uses wp_nav_menu() function from WordPress core.
*   - URE does not override WordPress front-end menu output method as earlier, it uses reqexp to insert custom action to the right place of WordPress front-end menu output.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: 
*      - User with 'manage_categories' capability, but without 'edit_posts' one, did not have access to the Posts->Categories, Posts->Tags menu items with active "Admin menu access" add-on.
*      - 'Block not selected' model did not allow search and sort operations with categories and tags. User was redirected to the dashboard automatically.
* Fix: Incompatibility issue with Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin was fixed - meta boxes added by ACF were not recognized by "Widgets access" add-on.
* Update: Direct access to the global $current_user variable is excluded from the code. Current user data is initialized via WordPress core functions wp_get_current_user() or get_current_user_id().
* Update: Various unused pieces of code were removed.
*
* Core version was updated to 4.36.1

  Full list of User Role Editor options is available here: https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/options-list
* Update: Users page - Grant Roles. It's possible to change just "Other roles" for multiple users and leave their primary roles untouched. Just leave a "Primary role" field empty.

* Update: Options page screen help text was updated.
* Fix: Additional (other) default roles set at URE's settings page are not granted to a new user now, if they were deselected at a 'Add New User' page.

* Core version: 4.32.3
* Fix: Front end menu access add-on: a lot of pages became restricted for front-end menu due to logic mistake in an access checking code. As a result related menu items were hidden from menu without a visible reason.

* Core version: 4.32.3
* New: Front end menu access add-on: 
*   - "Not logged-in and logged-in users with selected roles" option was added.

* New: Content view restrictions add-on: 
*   - Shortcode [user_role_editor] roles / except_roles attributes support '&&' role ID separator. For example roles="subscriber && customer" means that user should have both roles simultaneously, comparing to the roles="subscriber, customer" which works for subscribers or customers or (subscribers and customers).
*   - public static method URE_Content_View_Restrictions::current_user_can_view($post_id) was added. It returns boolean value.

= [4.33] 03.04.2017 =
* Core version: 4.32.3
* New: Content view restrictions add-on: authors list and own data only options were added for roles.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: 
*   - filter by categories may work incorrectly due to mistake in the SQL query;
*   - content-view-restrictions-controller.php used not existed function URE_Lib_Pro::filter_int_array().

* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: "Block not selected" model: 
*   - search a user at "Users" page was finished by the automatic redirection to the 1st available menu item (Dashboard, etc.). The list of allowed parameters for 'Users' page was extended for the search and sort parameters used at this page by WordPress core.

* Core version: 4.32.1
* New: Button "Grant Roles" allows to "Assign multiple roles to the selected users" directly from the "Users" page.
* Update: singleton template was applied to the main class User Role Editor Pro. While GLOBALS['user-role-editor'] reference to the instance of User_Role_Editor_Pro class is still available for the compatibility reasons, call to User_Role_Editor_Pro::get_instance() is the best way now to get a reference to the instance of User_Role_Editor_Pro class.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: PHP notice "Undefined index: ure_post_access_error_action in content-view-restrictions-controller.php" was removed.
* Fix: 'unfiltered_html' capability was added to the 'General' capabilities group.

= [4.32.2] 10.02.2017 =

* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: Blocked menu without submenu was not hidden.
* Fix: Gravity form access add-on: invalid redirection took place for many 'admin.php?page=some-page' URLs.

= [4.31] 15.12.2016 =
* Core version: 4.31
* New: It's possible to remove unused user capabilities by list.
* Fix: There was no support for installations with a hidden/changed URL to wp-admin. URE uses 'admin_url()' now to get and check admin URL, instead of direct comparing URL with 'wp-admin' string.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: custom links under Settings menu were converted from /wp-admin/options-general.php?page=some-key to /wp-admin/some-key incorrectly in some cases.
* Fix: Front-end menu access add-on: access controls were shown at menu editing form for user without 'ure_front_end_menu_access' capability.

* Core version: 4.30
* New: "Granted Only" checkbox to the right from "Quick Filter" input control allows to show only granted capabilities for the selected role.
* New: Front-end menu access add-on is available. It's possible to show menu items for everyone, logged-in users, logged-in users with selected role(s), not-logged-in visitors (<a href="https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/front-end-menu-access/">more info...</a>).
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: Top level menu items list is ordered similar way as WordPress itself use.
* Fix: Content view restrictions add-on: Content of a post prohibited for logged-in user with the selected role only was not shown for the not logged-in users. But it should be shown until this post is not prohibited apparently for the 'no_role' (No role for this site) virtual role too.
* Fix: Admin menu access add-on: There was automatic redirect to admin dashboard after WooCommerce->Coupons->Add New (or similar) button click under "Block menu items: Not Selected" model, in case "Posts->Add New" was not allowed.

* Core version: 4.29
* New: User Role Editor own user capabilities are grouped separately under Custom capabilities.
* Fix: Content View Restrictions add-on: Custom error message from the post editor was not shown in some cases, system global default message was shown instead.
* Fix: Content Edit Restrictions add-on: restricted user saw at post Visual editor a gallery with full list of available images instead of the allowed images included into this gallery only.
* Update: Content Edit Restrictions add-on: user with 'create_%' capability (like 'create_posts') can add new items (posts) inspite of editing restrictions applied to him. One of the purposes of this update was to allow to a user create the child pages under the allowed parent page.
* Update: Automatic updates server URL was changed to https://update.role-editor.com
* Update: URE_Lib::is_super_admin() uses WordPress core is_super_admin() for multisite setup only. Superadmin is a user with 'administrator' role in the case of single site WordPress installation.
*   This is the difference with the WordPress core which counts as a superadmin (for single site WP installation) any user with a 'delete_users' capability.
*   So it's possible to apply add-on restrictions (e.g. admin menu access) to the users without administrator role, but with 'delete_users' capability.
* Update: BaseLib::option_selected() calls were replaced with the calls of a similar selected() function from WordPress core.

= [4.29] 25.10.2016 =
* Core version: 4.28
* New: Meta Boxes access add-on: 'Remove' icon at admin page of this add-on allows to exclude from the list meta boxes which belong to the deleted plugins.
* Fix: Posts edit access restrictions add-on: 
        - sometimes restrictions were applied before a restricted custom post type was defined.<br>
        - post quant by the post status were calculated incorrectly for the "Prohibit" option.

    - The endless redirection loop could took place if the "Dashboard" menu was blocked ( URE_Admin_Menu_Access::update_menu_selected() ).<br>
    - URL for redirection to one of Jetpack submenu items was built incorrectly.
* Update: Admin menu access add-on: 
    - URL parameters 'action', 'menu' were registered as allowed for the 'nav-menus.php' ('Appearance->Menus') command to exclude unexpected redirections.<br>
    - WooCommerce products, orders, coupons filtering arguments in URLs are supported now.
      If you prohibited for the role 'Posts' menu, but allow WooCommerce 'Products', 'Orders' or 'Coupons' (use the same edit.php in URL), 
      you could meet a problem with filtering  WooCommerce product by category or product type, etc. User would be redirected to the dashboard - 
      This means that URLs with filtering parameters in it (like product_cat, product_type) was blocked by URE.<br>
    - Block not selected model: URE does not block by default these admin menu bar items: Profile, Log Out. Menu items was checked by URL. 
      Menu item ID is checked now instead, as URL may be changed by plugins, like one which changes 'wp-admin' to the custom string. 
      It's possible to modify the list of not blocked menu bar items ID using custom filter 'ure_do_not_remove_from_admin_bar'.
* Update: Posts view restrictions add-on: input form and list of default values were enhanced/extended.
* Update: Meta boxes access add-on takes into account the meta boxes placed by BuddyPress plugin to the user profile "Extended Profile" tab.
* New: WooCommerce plugin user capabilities (if exist) are grouped separately.

    - URE takes into account that "WCMp Commissions" menu from "WC Marketplace" plugin may be added as to "WooCommerce" menu, as a top level menu item;<br>
    - menu separators checking was moved to the separate static method;<br>
    - support was added for additional URL parameters which WordPress uses with 'edit.php', e.g.: trashed, untrashed, deleted, ids.<br>
    - support was added for additional URL parameters from plugins: Ninja Forms, EventON.
* Update: Posts edit restrictions add-on: URE does no replace posts statuses views (All, Mine, Published etc.) for the restricted user. It just refreshes the quant of posts for every existed status view.

          It's possible to switch off this extension via filter 'ure_edit_posts_access_add_orders_by_product_owner'. It should return false for that.
        - Quant by views was shown wrong for some custom post types, e.g. WooCommerce Orders.
        - bulk update from posts list wrote to the user profile wrong data;
* Fix: Admin menu access module:
    - 'user-edit.php' link was blocked by error with 'block not selected' model, which did not allow to edit a selected user.
    - access was allowed by error via direct URL to some menu items blocked with "block not selected" model.
    - Jetpack menu was not blocked. Admin menu copy creation is linked to the action with priority 999, to be executed after Jetpack, 
      which uses priority 998 for some reason.
    - 'UpdraftPlus' topbar admin menu was not removed when 'Settings->UpdraftPlus Backup' menu item was blocked.
* Fix: Content view restrictions module:
    - Prohibited posts titles/URLs were shown as 'Previous' or 'Next' links at the single post page.

* Update: Admin menu access module:
    - Enhanced technique of blocking links: order and quant of URL parameters does not matter.
    - Admin menu copy is refreshed automatically after any plugin activation for synchronization with possible menu changes.
    - When menu item is not allowed, it's replaced by the 1st allowed item from a child submenu or removed.
    - Multisite "My Sites" top bar admin menu does not show 'Dashboard' menu item for site if it's blocked for that site.
    - Some plugins/themes produces Menu/Submenu glitches ((Ultimate, Avada) for users with changed permissions. Such menu inconsistencies are fixed automatically.
* Update: Enhanced inner processing of custom post types list
* Update: Uses 15 seconds transient cache in order to not count users without role twice when 'restrict_manage_users' action fires.
* Update: URE fires action 'profile_update' after direct update of user permissions in order other plugins may catch such change.
* Update: All URE's PHP classes files were renamed and moved to the includes/classes subdirectory. Pro version part was moved under the "pro" directory.

    - 'user-edit.php' link was blocked by error with 'block not selected' model, which did not allow to edit a selected user.
    - admin menu copy is linked to the action with priority 1000 now, to be executed after Jetpack, which uses priority 998 for some reason.

* Fix: Admin menu access module: 
    - "Block not Selected" model blocked allowed URLs inside Media Library (started from upload.php) and Appearance Menus (started from nav-menus.php) and other allowed URLs (just with additional parameters).
    - WordPress Multisite - single site administrator get "Admin menu" dialog in the read-only mode for all roles. He should not edit just its own 'administrator' role.
    - Direct access to the blocked menu item via URL was possible for URLs like one from WooCommerce's "Products->Attributes" menu item: 
           wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=product&page=product_attributes.
    - Blocked menu item could be selected as the 1st available menu item which leaded to the endless redirect loop.
    - Blocked menu items search at the current user submenu copy was optimized (expanded or reordered submenu cases (like Events Manager) are processed correctly now).
* Fix: Meta Boxes access module: WooCommerce edit product/order page meta boxes were not hidden, fixed PHP notices generated in some cases.
* Fix: Export/Import module: PHP Notice: "Use of undefined constant value" was shown during import.

    2) Support for virtual 'exist' user capability was added. WordPress adds it automatically to every user.

* New: Edit posts restrictions add-on: Rules are applied automatically to the child pages of the allowed/blocked page.
  Use 'ure_auto_access_child_pages' filter if you wish to exclude the child pages from the edit restriction rules.
  It should be used as a 'must-use' plugin, because of this filter is applied earlier then theme is loaded. 
  It seems that it's too late to insert it into the theme's functions.php file.
* Update: Content view restrictions are applied now to the front-end only. Use edit restrictions add-on to manage posts/pages visibility at WordPress back-end.

* New: "Meta Boxes Access" add-on allows to manage access for roles to meta boxes of editor (posts, pages, custom post types) and dashboard pages (<a href="https://www.role-editor.com/documentation/block-meta-boxes-for-role/">more details...</a>).
* New: License key is checked in the real time after its input to help exclude input errors.

* Fix: Translation strings updated
* Update: German translation added


= [4.20] 15.10.2015 =
Core version: 4.19.3
Added option to force all custom posts types to use its own custom capabilities set instead of usage of one built on 'post', e.g. 'edit_videos' instead of 'edit_posts'.
User Role Editor Options page help section was updated.
Fix: Admin menu access restrictions were not applied at 'new-user.php' page under multisite for the single site administrator role with 'allow_edit_users_to_not_super_admin' option turned on. Special flag was set to indicate that single site admin gets raised (superadmin) permissions temporary for the 'user-new.php' page, but current user is not the superadmin really. (This temporary permissions raising is done to allow single site admin to add new users under multisite.)
Fix: Custom posts types selection query was updated to include all custom post types except 'built-in' types when adding custom capabilities for them.
Fix: Admin menu access: URLs beyound admin menu are not blocked for the "block not selected" model now. This allows to work with posts under this model of blocking for example.

More detailed notice messages are shown after default role change - to reflect a possible error or problem.
Other default roles (in addition to the primary role) was assigned to a new registered user for requests from the admin back-end only. Now this feature works for the requests from the front-end user registration forms too (including WordPress multisite).
Interface to Posts bulk action "Edit access" was available to the users without "ure_edit_posts_access" capability - fixed. Action itself was not fulfilled (blocked at server side) due to obvious permissions error.
Content view restrictions add-on: custom post types selection enhanced in order to include types which are not public 
Content view restrictions add-on: processes now custom post type content beyond the main loops, including 'wlbdash'(Dashboard) post type from "White Label Branding for WordPress Multisite" plugin.
Content edit restrictions add-on: supports unique create custom post type capability even in case it does not use 'edit_' in its name. For example for 'wlbdash' post type, create post capability will get name 'create_wlbdashs' instead of default 'wlb_dashboard_tool'.
Admin menu access add-on: bug was fixed for URL starting from 'admin.php?page='
Added new filter 'ure_get_allowed_gf_forms'. It allows to modify array of Gravity Forms ID available to the current user.
CSS enhanced to exclude column wrapping for the capabilities with the long names.
The translation text domain was changed to the plugin slug (user-role-editor) for the compatibility with translations.wordpress.org


= [4.19] 04.08.2015 =
* It is possible to assign to the user multiple roles directly through a user profile edit page. 
* Custom SQL-query (checked if the role is in use and slow on the huge data) was excluded and replaced with WordPress built-in function call. [Thanks to Aaron](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/poorly-scaling-queries).
* Bulk role assignment to the users without role was rewritten for cases with a huge quant of users. It processes just 50 users without role for the one request to return the answer from the server in the short time.
* Admin menu access add-on: 
*   1) 'block not selected' access model was added to the default 'block selected' one. It is more convenient in cases when you wish to block automatically all new added menu items.

* It is possible to set restrictions to the main site widgets at the Network Admin and replicate them to the whole network. 
* Other roles access add-on: 
*   1) 'block not selected' access model was added to the default 'block selected' one. It is more convenient in cases when you wish to block automatically all new added roles.
*   2) use top checkbox control to select/unselect all checkboxes. Click on it with 'Shift' key inverts current selection.

*   3) Fixed to work for the custom post types with own user capabilities set.
*   4) "No role for this site" item is available in the roles list at a post level interface.
*   5) Restriction is not applied to the post by default if logged in user can edit it. It is possible to change this rule
*   using filter 'ure_restrict_content_view_for_authors_and_editors'. It takes and returns 1 boolean parameter: false - do not restrict, true - restrict.
*   6) Enhanced compatibility with the Events Manager plugin ( https://wordpress.org/plugins/events-manager ).
*   7) Fixed bug which did not allow to open roles list for a new (not saved) post.
*   8) It is possible to retrieve post view access restrictions data for the post ID from other plugins, 
    for example do not sent new post notification to the users, who don't have access to view it. 
*   Function ure_get_post_view_access_users() returns the object with properties: 
*     1) restriction: string: prohibited/allowed; 
*     2) roles - array of roles, for which this restriction is applied; 
*     3) users: array of user ID, which have those roles.   
* Edit posts/pages restrictions add-on: 
*   1) Bug fix: when user with posts/pages edit restrictions may access restricted posts/pages directly by post ID and got 'Edit' URL for the restricted post at the front-end.  
*   2) If you set 'edit posts/pages with author user ID' restriction, it is applied to ALL post types. That is if author does not have any posts at some post type, user will see the empty list of posts at that type. 
If you set 'edit posts/pages/custom post types with ID' only then restrictions are applied only to the post types to which posts belongs.
*   3) It is possible now to set edit restrictions for the user by category/taxonomy ID.
*   4) Pages filtering enhanced for compatibility with other plugins, respecting "get_pages" filter (like "CMS Tree Page View" one).
*   5) User with post/pages edit restrictions applied can see own unattached media library items in additions to the allowed posts attachments.
*   6) If posts/pages restrictions were not set for the user, full list of media library items is available.
*   7) Filter ure_attachments_show_full_list allows to show full Media Library items list to the user with editing restrictions set.
*   8) Filter ure_posts_show_full_list allows to show full posts/pages/custom posts types list to the user with editing restrictions set.

= [4.18.5] 14.06.2015 =
* It is possible to input license code to the wp-config.php now. Add this line:

* Bug fix: Edit posts/pages restrictions add-on: Now user can not edit prohibited post/page manually inserting its ID to the edit URL.
* Admin menu access add-on: 'Customize' menu item is available now for non-English WordPress default languages too.

= [4.18.3] 06.05.2015 =
* Bug fix for "Admin menu access" add-on: direct access to the wp-admin/customize.php link (Appearance->Customize menu item) was not blocked properly. 
* As additional security measure "Welcome" panel is removed for the role with access restriction to the "Customize" admin menu item.

= [4.18.2] 30.04.2015 =
* Calls to the functions add_query_arg(), remove_query_arg() are escaped with esc_url_raw() to exclude potential XSS vulnerabilities.

* Fixed PHP fatal error for "Reset" roles operation.
* Fixed current user capability checking before URE Options page open.
* 3 missed phrases were added to the translations files.

= [4.18] 11.02.2014 =

* Posts/pages edit access restriction add-on functionality was extended to the Media Library. Posts/pages attachments becomes unavailable automatically if correspondent post/page edit is prohibited.
* Posts/pages edit access restriction add-on works with custom post types now.
* Posts/pages view access restriction works with custom post types now.
* Admin menu items with empty user capability are available in "Admin menu access" add-on now. "Participants Database" plugin defines its menu this way.
* Some plugins use meta capabilities instead of real user capabilities, like 'jetpack_admin_page' in "JetPack" or 'wpcf7_read_contact_forms' in "Contact Form 7". "Admin menu access" add-on recognizes such meta capabilities now. These meta-caps are replaced at "Admin menu" window with correspondent (mapped) real user capabilities for your further reference.
* Admin menu access add-on updated: 'Howdy, ...' menu including 'Logout' menu item at top bar admin menu will not disappear after blocking 'Profile' menu. 
* Top bar menu 'SEO' from "WP SEO from Yoast" plugin is blocked if user has no 'manage_options' capability or correspondent admin menu is blocked.

* More universal checking applied to the custom post type capabilities creation to exclude not existing property notices.
* New option "Edit user capabilities" was added. If it is unchecked - capabilities section of selected user will be shown in the readonly mode. Administrator (except superadmin for multisite) can not assign capabilities to the user directly. He should make it using roles only.
* Fixed JavaScript bug with 'Reset Roles' for FireFox v.34.

= [4.17] =
* "Other roles access" additional module was added. It allows to define which other roles user with current role may see at WordPress: dropdown menus, e.g assign role to user editing user profile, etc.
* Correspondent front-end admin menu bar items are blocked according to settings of "Admin menu blocking" add-on.
* Edit access restrictions add-on: Bulk actions helper was added. It is possible to select posts from the posts list and allow/prohibit access for editing them to the group of users. Go to the "Posts/Pages", select bulk action "Edit Access" and click "Apply".
* uninstall.php was updated to delete data of "Widgets access", "Other roles access" add-ons.
* Multisite: - case when URE was not network activated: It is possible to use own settings for single site activated instances of User Role Editor. It used the only version of settings values from the main blog earlier. 
  Important - in order to have ability to setup updates automatically URE should be activated for the main blog of the network.
  Some critical options were hidden from the "Multisite" tab for single site administrators. Single site admin should not have access to the options which purpose is to restrict him.
  Attention! In case you decide to allow single site administrator activate/deactivate User Role Editor himself, setup this PHP constant at the wp-config.php file:
  define('URE_ENABLE_SIMPLE_ADMIN_FOR_MULTISITE', 1);
  Otherwise single site admin will not see User Role Editor in the plugins list after its activation. User Role Editor hides itself under multisite from all users except superadmin by default.

= [4.16] 12.09.2014 =
* Rename role button was added to the URE toolbar. It allows to change user role display name (role ID is always the same). Be careful and double think before rename some built-in WordPress role.
* "create_sites" user capability was added to the list of built-in WordPress user capabilities for WordPress multisite. It does not exist by default. But it is used to control "Add New" button at the "Sites" page under WordPress multisite network admin.
* bug fix: WordPress database prefix value was not used in 2 SQL queries related to the "count users without role" module - updated.
* Admin menu access module: front-end admin menu bar was hidden for user for which you blocked at least one admin menu items.
* Admin menu access module: fixes for the processing of "Appearance" menu and its items "Themes", "Customize" (required user capability, etc.).
* Roles export: file name with exported roles data is built now using this scheme: ure-roles-backup_Y-m-d_h_i_s.dat, e.g. ure-roles-backup_2014-09-05_15_23_09.dat

= [4.15] 30.08.2014 =
* Widgets permissions module was added. If role has access to the "Widgets" menu item of "Appearance" menu, you may block access to the selected widgets for that role. Use a new "Widgets" button at the role editor page.

= [4.14.4] 04.08.2014 =
* Fix for: PHP Notice:  <code>Undefined variable: user_role_editor in user-role-editor-pro.php on line 69</code> introduced in version 4.14.2. If automatic updates feature was broken for you for that reason, update to this version manually.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was updated for admin menu blocking module.

= [4.14.3] 25.07.2014 =
* Integer "1" as default capability value for new added empty role was excluded for the better compatibility with WordPress core. Boolean "true" is used instead as WordPress itself does.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WordPress multisite.
* Roles import module may import role with integer (not boolean) capability value "1". Error was shown earlier. 
* Error message from import roles module shows role and capability which does not pass the validation rule.

= [4.14.2] 24.07.2014 =
* Admin menu access module: 
    - Bug was fixed which prevented to prohibit direct URL access to the blocked menu items. Recheck roles blocked admin menu items after installing this update as with low probability you may need to redefine them from the scratch. Try to deactivate/activate plugin 1st (Network deactivate/Network Activate for WP multisite). Generally it helps according to the test results;
    - role menu permissions processing was updated for the Gravity Forms plugin under WP multisite.
* Integration with Gravity Forms permissions system was enhanced for WP multisite.
* MySQL query optimized in order to reduce memory consumption.
* Extra WordPress nonce field was removed from the post at main role editor page.
* The instance of main plugin class User_Role_Editor is available for other developers via $GLOBALS['user_role_editor']
* Compatibility issue with the theme ["WD TechGoStore"](http://wpdance.com) is resolved. This theme loads its JS and CSS stuff for admin backend unconditionally - for all pages except loading for its own pages only. 
While the problem is caused just by CSS, URE unloads for optimization purpose all this theme's JS and CSS from WP admin backend pages where conflict is possible.
* Fix for the issue with periodic URE license key value disappearance at WordPress multi-site.
* Minor code enhancements.

= [4.12.1] 01.07.2014 =
* Technical update to fix the issue with the automatic updates API link. This link should start from <code>https://www.role-editor.com</code> instead of <code>https://role-editor.com</code>
This is related to migration of <code>role-editor.com</code> to the Google App Engine platform, which does not support SSL for the naked custom domains and 
force us to use SSL secured links from www subdomain, e.g. <code>https://www.role-editor.com</code> in our case. Starting from this version automatic update is in the working state.

= [4.3] 12.08.2013 =
* "User Role Editor" is available under the "Users" submenu of "Network Admin" for multisite installation. 
It provides the central point for users roles management of the whole network. Your changes are applied to the main site by default.
The click on "Network Update" button replicates roles from the main site to the whole network at once.
* Multisite update: roles from the main (1st) blog are copied to the new added blog automatically, 
even new site is added from front-end after new user registration, e.g. Gravity Forms "Register User" addon does. Earlier this feature worked 
for administrator back-end operations only.
* Bug prevented to apply role changes to all sites of the network is fixed. In case when one of the sites have exactly the same roles as applied from the main site, MySQL returned 0 rows affected. URE recognized that as error and stopped further network updated. It is fixed now.

* User interface bug with options 'Show capabilities in human readable form' and 'Show deprecated capabilities' fixed. 
Now this checkboxes work this way: It takes global values from the User Role Editor Settings 1st. If you change it at Roles/User editor form plugin, 
it remembers your change temporally for 10 minutes. After that this value will be returned to the URE global settings. 
If you wish to make permanent change make it at URE settings page.

* User with super-admin privilege only may create, edit, delete users by default under multi-site configuration. Use new "Allow create, edit and delete user to not super-administrators" option to workaround this obstacle. Such user still should have correspondent user capabilities as "create_users", "edit_users", "delete_users".
